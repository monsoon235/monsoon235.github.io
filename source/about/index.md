I'm a 2nd-year PhD student of University at Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) since Aug 2024.
Currently, my research interest is in Machine Learning Systems.
I'm working with [Prof. Minjia Zhang](https://minjiazhang.github.io/) of [Supercomputing System AI Lab (SSAIL)](https://supercomputing-system-ai-lab.github.io/).
In the past I explored 3D vision (e.g., Feature Matching and NeRF).

I obtained my Master's (2024) and Bachelor's Degree (2021) from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
